## Objectives 

This project delivers a statistically‑grounded profile of the global Top 200 YouTubers, using data sourced from SocialBook’s real time influencer analytics platform. 

It has three linked objectives:

 - Describe the landscape: visualising how followers, likes, views, engagement rate and “boost index” are distributed across video categories and creator countries through bar charts, treemaps, packed‑bubble plots and histograms. 

- Test for significant differences in audience behaviour: applying a one‑way ANOVA to determine whether average 1‑day, 3‑day and 7‑day view counts differ across countries. 
- Model what drives popularity—running multiple linear regression to discover which engagement metrics most strongly predict subscriber counts, providing actionable insight for marketers and creators. 

By integrating descriptive and inferential statistics, the study aims to identify where influence is concentrated, how engagement patterns vary, and which factors best explain a channel’s follower base—insights that inform data‑driven influencer selection and content strategy.
